Practice Datasets -- Data Science and Machine Learning
=========================

Several useful public datasets are included in this repository to practice your Data Science and Machine Learning skills. These datasets are also used in the course on ["Data Science and Machine Learning using Python - A Bootcamp"](https://scienceacademy.thinkific.com/courses/data-science-machine-learning-using-python-a-bootcamp).

The course is available on the following platforms:
* [Our School Website](https://scienceacademy.thinkific.com/)
* [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/r/user/junaidqazi)

For free contents, please subscribe to our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxHFPEzvTvpIqyYouzn8QX5gBYGo-m0Z).

The repository is created to ensure that the datasets remain available without any dependence on party involvement.
