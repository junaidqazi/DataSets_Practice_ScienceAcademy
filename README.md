Practice Datasets -- Data Science and Machine Learning
=========================

Several useful public datasets are included in this repository to practice your Data Science and Machine Learning skills. These datasets are also used in the course on "Data Science and Machine Learning using Python - A Bootcamp".

The course is available on the following platforms:
* [Our future school website](https://scienceacademy.thinkific.com/courses/data-science-machine-learning-using-python-a-bootcamp)
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-using-python-bootcamp-qazi/). 
* [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/r/user/junaidqazi)
* [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxHFPEzvTvpIqyYouzn8QX5gBYGo-m0Z) -- We are adding contents with time.

The repository is created to ensure that the datasets remain available without any dependence on party involvement. 

In many cases, tutorials will link directly to the raw dataset URL, therefore dataset filenames should not be changed once added to the repository.
